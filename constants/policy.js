    Website the operator of a social media plugin may set cookies or other
    tracking technology on your browser, enabling that social media operator to
    recognize individuals who visit the Website, the FIIT Website. If you are

    viewed, and connect the visit to your user Information. The social media
    plugins also allow the social media website to share information about your

    media website&#39;s privacy policy, so we encourage you to use care and

    tracking technologies that automatically collect and store certain
    information whenever you interact with the Website or the FIIT Website, view
    or click on advertisements, or visit our social media pages. This includes
    log data that automatically records information about your visit, such as
    your browser type, operating system, the URL of the page that referred you,
    the different actions you performed, and the IP address you used to access
    pages on the Website or the FIIT Website. We use this information to
    administer the Website and the FIIT Website, analyze trends, provide you
    with an experience that is relevant to your location based on the IP
    address, gather information about visitor movements, help diagnose potential
    problems with our server, investigate actual or potential security
    incidents, and ensure the Website and the FIIT Website are working properly.
    If you use the FIIT App, we also automatically collect information related
    to your mobile device operating system name and version, device manufacturer
    and model, mobile device identifier, browser language, and the version of
    the FIIT App you are using. We use this information for purposes such as
    ensuring that the FIIT App functions properly and to understand usage of the
    FIIT App. We may assign your computer or mobile device one or more cookies
    to facilitate access to the Services, and to personalize your online
    experience. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user&#39;s
    computer or mobile device for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either
    session cookies or persistent cookies. A flash cookie is similar to a
    cookie, but it can store more complex data in order to remember settings,
    preferences, and usage. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent
    cookies. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your
    browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your devices until you delete
    them) to: (1) allow you to use the Services without having to re-enter your
    user name and password; (2) provide you with a more personal and interactive
    experience; (3)monitor usage of the Services; (4) manage the Services; and
    (5) improve the Services. These cookies may be delivered by us or by third

    information about your interaction with us to present you with opportunities
    to purchase our products and services. Retargeting cookies also are used to
    present you with PEMRS on other websites based on your interaction with the
    Services. The Website and the FIIT Website use Google Analytics, a web
    analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (&quot;Google&quot;). Google uses
    cookies to help us analyze how visitors use the Website and the FIIT
    Website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the
    Website and the FIIT Website is generally transmitted to and stored on a
    Google server in the United States. In case of activation of IP
    anonymization, Google will, however, truncate/anonymize the last eight-bit
    segment of your IP address beforehand within Member States of the European
    Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only
    in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google
    server in the United States and truncated there. On behalf of the operator
    of the Website and the FIIT Website, Google will use this information for
    the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website and the FIIT Website,
    compiling reports on Website and FIIT Website activity, and providing the
    operator with other services relating to the Website, the FIIT Website, and

    protect any Personal Information they may receive in a manner consistent
    with this policy. We may share aggregate or anonymous information in various
    formats with trusted third parties, and may work with those entities to do
    research and provide products and services, as permitted by laws and our

    Social Media The Website, the FIIT Website interface with social media
    websites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube, and may use
    social media plugins (such as the Facebook &quot;Like&quot; button) to
    facilitate social media functions. When you visit the Website or the FIIT
    Website the operator of a social media plugin may set cookies or other
    tracking technology on your browser, enabling that social media operator to
    recognize individuals who visit the Website, the FIIT Website. If you are
    logged into a social media website while browsing on the Website or the
    PEMRS Website, the social media plugins may allow the social media website
    to receive information about your visit, including the pages that you
    viewed, and connect the visit to your user Information. The social media
    plugins also allow the social media website to share information about your
    activities on the Website, the FIIT Website with other users of their social
    media website. For example, Facebook social media plugins allow Facebook to
    show your Likes and comments on the Website and the FIIT Website to your
    Facebook friends. Your use of social media plugins is subject to each social
    media website&#39;s privacy policy, so we encourage you to use care and
    thoughtfully read the privacy policy of each social media website that you
    use. We have no control over the information that social media websites or
    plugins collect, store, or use. Before connecting to the Website, the FIIT
    Website from a social media website, or using a social media plugin on the

    media website&#39;s privacy policy and how it may gather information about
    your access to the Website and the FIIT Website and what you view on the

    your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, and we
    currently are not able to respond to those signals. Disclosure of
    Information We may use and disclose all of the information (described above)
    that we collect as stated above and in accordance with the terms set forth
    in this Privacy Policy. We do not reveal your user Information to third
    parties except in the following circumstances:  We may transfer your
    information to our distributors, agents, third parties, or service providers

    working with us may handle the processing of customer service, data
    management, e-mail distribution, market research, information analysis,
    promotions management, social media marketing, and similar services. We also
    may use cloud service providers to host the Services and store data, and
    these service providers inform us that they apply security measures they
    consider adequate for the protection of the information within their system.
    They have access to user Information needed to perform their functions.  We
    may disclose your information if we believe it is needed to comply with the
    law(e.g., search warrant, subpoena or court order), respond to a
    governmental or regulatory request; to address disputes or claims; to
    protect the security or integrity of the Services; to enforce an agreement
    we have with you; or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the

    contractually prohibit recipient of the data from re-identifying it back to
    you or your patients or clients. Security We are committed to taking
    reasonable efforts to secure the information that we collect, and we use a
    variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect against
    unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. We

    their websites comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules. Third

    responsible for, the privacy or security practices of any third parties,
    including our third-party service providers (i.e. cloud service providers),
    your doctors and, if applicable, Apple, Inc., Google, Inc., and any other
    third party operating any software application or website to which any of
    the Services contains a link. The inclusion of a link on any of the Services
    does not imply endorsement of the linked software application or website by
    us. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of other
    websites you visit. Opting Out You have choices about how we use and
    disclose your user Information in connection with marketing efforts. You may

    of such information by any third party. If you opt out of receiving
    marketing-related messages from us, we still may send you service-related
    communications. Data Retention We retain user Information as long as we

    information as otherwise required by law.  Updating or Deleting User
    Information You may update your account or profile at any time through the
    applicable Service. You also may delete your account or profile from the
    applicable Service. Please note that deleting your account or profile does
    not delete user Information previously submitted through the applicable
    Service. If users of the FIIT App delete the FIIT App altogether, their user
    Information will be deleted from the FIIT Portal in ninety (90) days; any
    such user Information already transferred from the Portal into your
    electronic medical record by your doctor, however, will not be affected by
    such deletion. Changes to This Privacy Policy As PEMRS, its products, and
    its services change from time to time, this Privacy Policy is expected to
    change as well. We reserve the right to amend the Privacy Policy at any

    you provide to us current, and to promptly notify us of any changes to your
    e- mail address so that you may receive any notices we send you regarding
    material changes to the privacy policy. You should stop using the affected

    are not subject to the Rules and Regulations associated with HIPAA or HITECH
    as this App is being directly offered to you for your own personal benefit
    independent from any healthcare or medical services and it is also not being
    offered to you by or on behalf of any independent third-party healthcare
    providers or Covered Entities. PEMRS still follows Applicable Laws,

    Data within the App and use that de- identified Medical Data in aggregate or
    non-aggregate forms for research studies, evaluation of the App and our
    services or functionality, quality improvement purposes, or for any other
    lawful commercial purpose in accordance with our Privacy Policy. PEMRS’ use
    and disclosure of any de-identified Medical Data in aggregated or

    Laws and Regulations. You agree that you consent to such disclosures and
    uses of de-identified Medical Data, and that PEMRS is not obligated to pay
    any amount to you or otherwise compensate you or any other person in any way
    for such disclosures and uses, and that PEMRS is not required to furnish you
    with any other information of any kind regarding such disclosures and uses,
    and to the extent that you have proprietary interest in any such
    de-identified Medical Data, you waive any right to such interest and you
    waive any right to seek compensation for such disclosures or uses. You also
    agree that unless you consent to this use of de-identified Medical Data,
    PEMRS will not provide you with access to the App. 7. Optional Consent to
    Disclosure and Use of Medical Data in Identifiable Form You agree that at
    your own personal discretion, you may also use the FIIT App to provide
    optional authorization and consent for your Medical Data to be shared in

    healthcare providers. You agree that those independent third-party
    healthcare providers are solely responsible for and will have complete
    authority, responsibility, supervision, and control over the provision of

    diagnoses, treatments, procedures, and other professional healthcare
    services will be provided and performed exclusively by or under the
    supervision of independent third-party healthcare providers as they, in
    their sole discretion, deem appropriate. You acknowledge and agree that
    PEMRS and the App do not provide or endorse any medical advice through the

    audiovisual content, data, other materials and any other information

    Agreements to safeguard the integrity and availability of the App and any
    content or information transferred to, from, or available within. However,
    when using the App, information may be transmitted over a medium that may be

    diagnoses, treatments, procedures, and other services provided in connection
    with using the App or otherwise referencing the content or information
    available within it. 9. Third-Party Access You agree and consent that your
    usage of any of the available methods within the App for sharing access with
    others constitutes your implicit consent and authorization for PEMRS to use
    and make your Personal Data and Medical Data available to others in
    accordance with those methods and your inputs, as well as the terms and
    conditions of our Agreements. You are solely responsible for ensuring the
    accuracy and validity of the contact information of recipients whom you
    grant access to your FIIT PHR. PEMRS is not responsible for the disclosure
    of Medical Data to recipients based on incorrect, erroneous, or invalid
    contact information submitted by you through the Application. You can use
    the FIIT App to grant more limited access to recipients, such as providing
    access only to specific documents in your PHR, providing access that expires
    after a set amount of time, and other settings as made available within the
    App. 10. Access to Software by Minors The Children’s Online Privacy and
    Protection Act requires that online service providers, which are
    consistently accessed by children under the age of 13 years old, obtain

    negotiations, conversations, discussions, agreements, and all past dealings

    Agreements, or to the extent expressly permitted by local law, no part of
    the App or its content may be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded,
    posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, or distributed
    in any way to any other computer, server, website, or other medium for
    publication or distribution or for any commercial enterprise or purpose,

    Services. You further agree and consent for your Personal Data to be

    defined under HIPAA and similar terms as defined by state, national, or
    international law. You agree and consent that both the FIIT App and PEMRS
    are not subject to the Rules and Regulations associated with HIPAA or HITECH
    as this App is being directly offered to you for your own personal benefit
    independent from any healthcare or medical services and it is also not being
    offered to you by or on behalf of any independent third-party healthcare
    providers or Covered Entities. PEMRS still follows Applicable Laws,
    Regulations, and Standards related to the protection and privacy of data,
    such as using encryption technologies and processes to ensure the security
    of your Medical Data while it is at rest or in motion. You agree and consent
    that PEMRS may collect, create, receive, transmit, maintain, and otherwise
    use your Medical Data in order to provide you with access to the App and its
    Services. You also agree that unless you consent to this use of Medical
    Data, PEMRS will not provide you with access to the App. PEMRS™only
    collects, creates, receives, transmits, maintains, and otherwise shares
    Medical Data with individuals that you authorize and give consent to through
    the App. 6. Consent to Disclosure of Medical Data in De-Identified Form You
    agree and consent that PEMRS may de-identify and/or anonymize (remove all
    information that could be used to specifically identify you) your Medical
    Data within the App and use that de- identified Medical Data in aggregate or
    non-aggregate forms for research studies, evaluation of the App and our
    services or functionality, quality improvement purposes, or for any other
    lawful commercial purpose in accordance with our Privacy Policy. PEMRS’ use
    and disclosure of any de-identified Medical Data in aggregated or
    non-aggregated forms will be conducted in compliance with all Applicable
    Laws and Regulations. You agree that you consent to such disclosures and
    uses of de-identified Medical Data, and that PEMRS is not obligated to pay
    any amount to you or otherwise compensate you or any other person in any way
    for such disclosures and uses, and that PEMRS is not required to furnish you
    with any other information of any kind regarding such disclosures and uses,
    and to the extent that you have proprietary interest in any such
    de-identified Medical Data, you waive any right to such interest and you
    waive any right to seek compensation for such disclosures or uses. You also
    agree that unless you consent to this use of de-identified Medical Data,
    PEMRS will not provide you with access to the App. 7. Optional Consent to
    Disclosure and Use of Medical Data in Identifiable Form You agree that at
    your own personal discretion, you may also use the FIIT App to provide
    optional authorization and consent for your Medical Data to be shared in
    identifiable forms (with information that could be used to specifically
    identify you). You agree that this optional authorization and consent is not
    a pre-condition or requirement in order to use the App or to receive any
    medical treatment, payment, or benefit for which you may be eligible. You
    agree that you are freely able to use this App and its related services
    without providing this optional authorization and consent, and that you are
    free to revoke your authorization and consent for sharing identifiable
    Medical Data at any time. You agree that if you provide this optional
    authorization and consent, PEMRS may share your identifiable Medical Data in
    aggregate or non-aggregate forms for research studies, evaluation of the App
    and our services or functionality, quality improvement purposes, or for any
    other lawful commercial purpose in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
    PEMRS’ use and disclosure of any identifiable Medical Data in aggregated or
    non-aggregated forms will be conducted in compliance with all Applicable
    Laws and Regulations. You agree that your optional consent allows for such
    disclosures and uses of identifiable Medical Data, and that PEMRS is not
    obligated to pay any amount to you or otherwise compensate you or any other
    person in any way for such disclosures and uses, and that PEMRS is not
    required to furnish you with any other information of any kind regarding
    such disclosures and uses, and to the extent that you have proprietary
    interest in any such identifiable Medical Data, you waive any right to such
    interest and you waive any right to seek compensation for such disclosures
    or uses. 8. No Medical Advice, Treatment, or Diagnosis PEMRS and the App do
    not provide medical advice, treatment, or diagnosis. You acknowledge and
    agree that the App is merely a conduit of Medical Data related to you and
    the provision of healthcare provided to you by independent third-party
    healthcare providers. You agree that those independent third-party
    healthcare providers are solely responsible for and will have complete
    authority, responsibility, supervision, and control over the provision of
    all medical services, advice, instructions, treatment decisions, and other
    professional health care services that are performed. You agree that all
    diagnoses, treatments, procedures, and other professional healthcare
    services will be provided and performed exclusively by or under the
    supervision of independent third-party healthcare providers as they, in
    their sole discretion, deem appropriate. You acknowledge and agree that
    PEMRS and the App do not provide or endorse any medical advice through the
    App and that no information obtained through the App can be so used. PEMRS
    has and will exercise absolutely no control, authority, or supervision over
    the provision of any medical services or other professional health care
    services. The use of the App, all text, graphics, images, audio content,
    audiovisual content, data, other materials and any other information
    provided on, entered into, or made available through the App, including all
    healthcare related information, whether provided by you or independent
    third- party healthcare providers, is solely yours and their responsibility.
    PEMRS makes all reasonable efforts in accordance with Applicable Laws and
    Agreements to safeguard the integrity and availability of the App and any
    content or information transferred to, from, or available within. However,
    when using the App, information may be transmitted over a medium that may be

    liability for or relating to the delay, failure, interruption, or corruption
    of any data or other information transmitted in connection the use of the
    App that is reasonably determined to be beyond PEMRS’ direct control. You
    acknowledge and agree that independent third-party healthcare providers are
    solely responsible for all medical services, advice, instructions,
    diagnoses, treatments, procedures, and other services provided in connection
    with using the App or otherwise referencing the content or information
    available within it. 9. Third-Party Access You agree and consent that your
    usage of any of the available methods within the App for sharing access with
    others constitutes your implicit consent and authorization for PEMRS to use
    and make your Personal Data and Medical Data available to others in
    accordance with those methods and your inputs, as well as the terms and
    conditions of our Agreements. You are solely responsible for ensuring the
    accuracy and validity of the contact information of recipients whom you
    grant access to your FIIT PHR. PEMRS is not responsible for the disclosure
    of Medical Data to recipients based on incorrect, erroneous, or invalid
    contact information submitted by you through the Application. You can use
    the FIIT App to grant more limited access to recipients, such as providing
    access only to specific documents in your PHR, providing access that expires
    after a set amount of time, and other settings as made available within the
    App. 10. Access to Software by Minors The Children’s Online Privacy and
    Protection Act requires that online service providers, which are
    consistently accessed by children under the age of 13 years old, obtain
    parental consent before they collect personally identifiable information

    children under the age of 13, and our App is not directed at users under the
    age of 13. You acknowledge and agree that children under the age of 13 are
    prohibited from using our software. A parent, guardian, or personal
    representative may use the Software on behalf of a child under the age of
